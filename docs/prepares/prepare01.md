# CSE 180 Prepare 01 - Algorithms & Searching

An algorithm is a fancy word that represents the steps that we follow to accomplish a task.  We will look at several algorithms and algorithmic techniques during the semester.  We will begin with searching algorithms.  With every algorithm we look at, we will consider the following attributes of an algorithm:

* Discrete - The steps that form the algorithm ordered and each describe an unambiguous action to be performed with specific inputs (requirements) and outputs (results). 
* Deterministic - Each step is written so that it can be repeated by other people with the same result.  This is very important if we want a computer to perform the steps for us.
* Performance - How much work does it take to complete the steps?  If it takes too long, we might search for a better algorithm to perform the same task.
* Data Structures - How will the steps organize the data?  The choice of data structures can affect performance.

## Reading

* Lesson 1 (First class of the week) - [Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms/9781617292231/OEBPS/Text/kindle_split_007.html) - Introduction sub-sections
* Lesson 2 (Second class of the week) - [Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms/9781617292231/OEBPS/Text/kindle_split_007.html) - Binary Search sub-sections including Exercises 1.1 and 1.2

Notes about reading:

* The code examples in the book use Python 2.  All the examples in class will use Python 3.  The biggest difference is in Python 2 we can print to the screen: `print "hello"` whereas in Python 3 we use parentheses: `print("hello")`.
* You should complete the exercises in the book as part of your reading and studying time.  The answers are in the back of the book.  You will not submit the work you do on these exercises.
* The solution to exercises 1.1 and 1.2 are wrong and should be 1 more than the value shown in the book.  We will demonstrate this in class.
