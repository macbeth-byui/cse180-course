# CSE 180 Prepare 01 - What is an Algorithm

An algorithm is a fancy word that represents the steps that we follow to accomplish a task.  Since we do alot of tasks both in computers and without computers, an algorithm should be a natural thing that we think about.  Algorithms have the reputation of being complicated but they are a great tool for a software engineer.  The complexity usually comes from either the complexity of the original problem or the complexity of finding a better performing solution.  We will explore several well known algorithms during the course which you will enounter throughout your life.  These algorithms can be categorized into different types which will help us to form strategies to solve various problems.  The categories we will explore during the semester include:

* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
* Greedy Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming Algorithms

However, the first step is to appreciate what an algorithm is during the first week.  Next week we will look at our first one in software and discover how we can document the design of an algorithm.
