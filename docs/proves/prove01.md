## Question 1

During class we talked out making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and the importance of writing out discrete and deterministic steps.  Pick anytime of sandwich or other meal that takes multiple steps to prepare.  Identify the discrete steps, test it out (i.e. prepare the meal and eat it), and have someone else review what you wrote for their feedback.  After testing it out and getting feedback, improve your discrete steps again:

**What meal did you prepare**:

**Discrete Steps**:
1. Describe step 1
2. Describe step 2
3. Describe step 3

(add more steps as needed)

**Describe how the meal turned out**:

**First name of the person that reviewed your discrete steps**:

**Describe what you improved after testing and reviewing**:
