**Instructions**: Answer each question using proper markdown notation as needed.  Use the preview view in Visual Studio Code (or other editor you may be using) to see the formatting, tables, and mathematical formula.  If you need to write code, first test in a separate file and then copy the code into this document using code fences.  Submit the markdown file (not a pdf) into I-Learn.


## Question 1

If you had a list of 1000 numbers in a list, using either Selection Sort algorithm we explored in class, how much work would be required to sort the list in the worst case?  Give your answer in simplified big-O notation.

**Answer**:  

## Question 2

If you performed the expensive sort on the list of 1000 numbers described in question 1, how much work would it take to determine if a number is in the sorted list in the most efficient way possible?  Give your answer in simplified big-O notation and also provide an explanation.  We did not discuss this in lass this week, but you should reflect on what you have learned in prevoius weeks.

**Answer**: 

**Explanation**: 

## Question 3

If you performed the expensive sort on the list of 1000 numbers described in question 1, how much work would it take to add one more number and maintain the sorted list in the most efficient way possible?  Give your answer in simplified big-O notation and also provide an explanation.  We did not discuss this in class this week, but you should reflect on what you have learned in previous weeks.

**Answer**:  

**Explanation**:  

## Question 4

Write a procedure for the in-place Selection Sort algorithm to sort in descending order instead of ascending order.

**Procedure**
1. Describe step 1
2. Describe step 2
3. Describe step 3

(add more steps as needed)

## Question 5

The fibonancci code that we used in class is repeated below:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

How many calls to the function `fib` would occur if we called `fib(6)`.  Note that if just called `fib(0)`, then the total count would be 1.

**Answer**: 

## Question 6

Consider how you use recursion in every-day life.  Computer Science and Software Engineering students often need to remember that the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#/media/File:The_Scientific_Method.svg) is the means in which we solve problems.  Explain how the scientific method is recursive.  What is the recursive call?  How do we represent the solution in terms of using recursion on a smaller problem?  What are the base cases? 

**Answer**:
